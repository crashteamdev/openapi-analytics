name: filter
in: query
description: |-
  Fields and values in the filter are separated with :: ?filter=firstName:John.

  Multiple filters are separated with ;: ?filter=firstName:John;lastName:Doe.
  They are joined with AND logic. Example: firstName:John AND lastName:Doe.
  
  To use multiple values, use , as values separators: ?filter=firstName:John,Bob.
  Multiple values specified for a field are joined with OR logic. Example: firstName:John OR firstName:Bob.
  
  To negate the filter, use !: ?filter=firstName:!John.
  
  To negate the filter, use ~ ?filter=firstName:~John.
  
  To negate multiple values, use: ?filter=firstName:!John,!Bob. This filter rule excludes all Johns and Bobs from the response.
  
  To use range filters, use: ?filter=amount:1..10.
  
  To use a gte (greater than or equals) filter, use: ?filter=amount:1... This also works for datetime-based fields.
  
  To use a lte (less than or equals) filter, use: ?filter=amount:..10. This also works for datetime-based fields.
